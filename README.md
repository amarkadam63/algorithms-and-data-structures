# Algorithms and Data Structures

This project is a compilation of various algorithms and data structures that have been implemented using different programming lanaguages.

## Overview

The whole idea of this project is to re-visit the fundamentals of computer programming. However, what makes this project perhaps a little different is that these fundamentals will be explored using different programming languages. By exploring the funamentals using different programming languages (and paradigms), the aim is to develop an aptitude to think differently about solving problems.
